The function "run_analysis" produces two tidy data sets based on the raw data collected from accelerometers in Samsung Galaxy S smartphones 
across 30 subjects and 6 different types of activities.

The function will assign the two datasets to the global environment to be used for further processing. The two datasets are as follows:

-returnall - This returns the subject, activity description, mean, and standard deviation for both the train and test data sets from the raw
             data. The data is for each measurement in the base data set
-returnavg - This returns the average value for mean and standard deviation measurements grouped by subject and activity.

The below are prerequisites for this function:

(1) The function uses the dplyr package. Loading the dplyr library is part of the attached file
(2) The dataset will be loaded in a "data" sub-folder from the working directory.
